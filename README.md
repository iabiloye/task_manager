# Overview

As part of my growth as a software engineer, I am focusing on learning new programming languages, understanding different syntax styles, and improving my ability to build functional, real-world tools. This project allowed me to explore the Rust programming language and strengthen my skills in writing efficient, safe, and structured code.

For this project, I created a simple command-line Task Manager in Rust. The software allows users to add tasks, view all stored tasks, and mark them as completed. It demonstrates Rust concepts such as modules, structs, methods, input handling, ownership rules, and clean separation of program logic.

My purpose for writing this software was to deepen my understanding of Rust’s unique features especially memory safety, module organization, and its strict but powerful compiler. Building a small but meaningful application helped me better understand how Rust handles user input, mutability, and modular code structure.

# Development Environment

Development Environment: 
To develop this software, I used:
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my main editor
- Rust Analyzer extension for code suggestions and debugging
- Cargo (Rust’s build system and package manager) to manage the project and run the program
- Windows 10 terminal for running the command-line application
- Visual Studio Build Tools for C++

The programming language used is Rust, and the project uses only the standard library. Core concepts used include modules, structs, enums, methods, vectors, and standard input/output.

# Future Work

There are several features and improvements I plan to add:

- Ability to delete tasks
- Save and load tasks using a local file
- Add task editing functionality
- Improve error handling for invalid input
- Add colors or formatting to the command-line output for a better user experience.
